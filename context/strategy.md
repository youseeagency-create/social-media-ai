# Strategy

## Current Status

The tool is fully implemented as a Next.js local app with all core features working:
- Pipeline: scrape, filter, rank, analyze with Gemini, generate concepts with Claude
- UI: Dashboard, Videos browser, Run page, Configs CRUD, Creators CRUD
- Storage: CSV-based local data in `data/`

## Next Steps

- Test pipeline end-to-end with real API calls
- Improve error handling and retry logic for API failures
- Add more advanced filtering and sorting to the Videos page
- Consider persistent storage beyond CSV if data grows

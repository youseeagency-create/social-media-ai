# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

**Social Media AI** — a tool that helps create viral Instagram Reels by analyzing competitor content. It scrapes competitors' recent videos, identifies the most viral ones, analyzes them with AI (video understanding + content breakdown), and generates new adapted video concepts for a given brand.

---

## How to Run

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Required environment variables** (in `.env` at project root):
- `APIFY_API_TOKEN` — Apify Instagram scraper
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Google Gemini video analysis
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — Claude concept generation
- `SESSION_SECRET` — signs login session cookies (generate with `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"`)
- `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection string (Neon, provisioned via Vercel's Marketplace integration; same DB used for local dev and production for now)
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` — Vercel Blob store token for voice-note audio (auto-added when the Blob store is created; pulled locally into `app/.env.local` via `vercel env pull`)

**First-time setup**:
```bash
cd app
npx drizzle-kit generate   # only needed after changing src/lib/schema.ts
npm run db:migrate         # applies drizzle/*.sql to DATABASE_URL
# Set ADMIN_EMAIL, ADMIN_PASSWORD, ADMIN_NAME in .env, then:
npx tsx src/scripts/seed-auth.ts   # safe to re-run — skips if the email already exists
```

---

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui** components
- **CSV files** for pipeline data storage (`configs`/`creators`/`videos`, in `data/` directory)
- **Postgres (Neon)** via **Drizzle ORM** for auth/workspace data (`users`/`workspaces`/`workspace_clients`) — see "Multi-Client Platform" below
- **Apify** — Instagram scraping
- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** — Video analysis (upload + multimodal)
- **Claude Sonnet** — New concept generation

---

## How The System Works

### Pipeline Overview

1. **Input** — Select a config and parameters (max videos, top-K, days lookback) via the Run page
2. **Load Config** — Retrieve analysis prompt, new concepts prompt, and creator list from CSV
3. **Scrape** — For each competitor creator, scrape recent Instagram Reels via Apify
4. **Filter & Rank** — Filter by date, sort by views, take top-K most viral
5. **Analyze** — Download video, upload to Gemini, analyze (extracts Concept, Hook, Retention, Reward, Script)
6. **Generate** — Send analysis + brand context to Claude for adapted video concepts
7. **Save** — Append results to `data/videos.csv`, viewable in the Videos page with thumbnails. Thumbnails and creator avatars are downloaded once and cached under `data/media/` (via `src/lib/media.ts`) instead of storing the raw Instagram CDN URL, since those URLs are signed and expire.

### Two Customizable Prompts Per Config

- **Analysis Instruction** — How Gemini should break down the video
- **New Concepts Instruction** — How Claude should adapt the reference for the brand

## Multi-Client Platform (Auth + Workspaces)

This is being built out in stages into a multi-client platform. Stage 1 added authentication and a workspace shell (CSV-backed); that was then migrated to Postgres since Vercel's filesystem is read-only/ephemeral. Stage 2 made the Inspiration and Notes tabs functional; the Footage tab (per-workspace media library) followed. The remaining tabs (Analysis, Content Calendar, Reports) are still placeholders. `configs`/`creators`/`videos` are still CSV-backed — only the auth/workspace/tab entities moved to the database.

- **Two account types**: `admin` (sees/manages everything) and `client` (sees only their assigned workspace(s)).
- **Auth**: email/password login, sessions are signed HTTP-only cookies (`app/src/lib/session.ts`, Web Crypto HMAC — no auth library dependency). Password hashing via Node's `crypto.scrypt` (`app/src/lib/password.ts`). Route protection is centralized in `app/src/proxy.ts` (Next.js's `middleware.ts` convention, renamed to `proxy.ts` in Next 16 — must live in `src/` alongside `app/`, not at the project root).
- **Admin-only pages**: `/`, `/videos`, `/run`, `/configs`, `/creators`, `/admin` (and their API routes) all require an admin session. Non-admin/unauthenticated requests are redirected (pages) or get 401/403 JSON (API).
- **Admin dashboard** (`/admin`): create/rename/delete workspaces, create client accounts, assign clients to workspaces.
- **Workspace shell** (`/workspace/[workspaceId]/...`): 6 tabs. **Inspiration**, **Notes**, and **Footage** are functional; Analysis, Content Calendar, Reports are placeholders. Per-workspace access is checked in `app/src/app/workspace/[workspaceId]/layout.tsx` via `isUserAssignedToWorkspace` (admins bypass this check).
- **Inspiration tab**: save Instagram/TikTok/YouTube/other links per workspace (platform auto-detected in `app/src/lib/inspiration.ts`). Thumbnails: YouTube derived instantly; Instagram (Apify `scrapePostThumbnail`) and TikTok (free oEmbed) are scraped **asynchronously** — the link saves immediately with `thumbnail_status = pending`, then the client calls `POST /api/inspiration/thumbnail?id=` which resolves the cover URL (`app/src/lib/thumbnails.ts`), downloads it, and persists it to **Vercel Blob** (source CDN URLs are signed/expiring, so we store our own copy). Failures (private/deleted posts, rate limits, timeouts) flip status to `failed` and the card keeps its platform badge with a retry affordance. Deleting an item `del()`s its Blob thumbnail. **Notes tab**: text notes + browser-recorded voice notes in one chronological list. Voice audio is stored in **Vercel Blob** (`@vercel/blob`, public access) via the client-upload flow — `app/src/components/voice-recorder.tsx` records via `MediaRecorder`, uploads through `app/src/app/api/notes/upload/route.ts` (`handleUpload`, auth in `onBeforeGenerateToken`), then the note row is saved client-side (the completion webhook doesn't fire locally). Deleting a voice note also `del()`s its blob. Requires `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (from the Vercel Blob store).
- **Footage tab**: per-workspace media library. Upload video/image/audio files (drag-drop or picker, multi-file, 500 MB cap) via Vercel Blob **client-upload** with a progress bar (`app/src/components/footage-tab.tsx` → `POST /api/footage/upload` `handleUpload`, same auth pattern as voice notes; `maximumSizeInBytes` enforces the cap). Files render with inline players (`<video>`/`<audio>`/`<img>`). `kind` is derived server-side from the content type (`app/src/lib/footage.ts`). Deleting an item `del()`s its blob.
- **Client-facing tab API routes** (`/api/inspiration`, `/api/notes`, `/api/notes/upload`, `/api/inspiration/thumbnail`, `/api/footage`, `/api/footage/upload`) are intentionally **not** under the admin-only `/api/workspaces/*` prefix and are **not** in the `proxy.ts` matcher — each handler authorizes with `requireWorkspaceAccess(workspaceId)` (`app/src/lib/auth.ts`: admin bypass, else `isUserAssignedToWorkspace`), so both admins and assigned clients can read/write their own workspace's data.
- **Data**: Postgres tables `users`, `workspaces`, `workspace_clients`, `inspiration_items`, `notes`, `footage` (schema in `app/src/lib/schema.ts`, queries in `app/src/lib/db.ts`).
- **Known limitation**: deleting a workspace cascades its DB rows but does **not** delete the Blob objects (voice notes, IG/TikTok thumbnails, footage) — blobs are only `del()`d on individual-item delete. Orphaned blobs would need a sweep if this matters later. All workspace-scoped tables have `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `workspace_id` (deleting a workspace clears its content); `created_by` FKs use `ON DELETE SET NULL`. Schema changes: edit `schema.ts`, run `npx drizzle-kit generate` (writes SQL to `app/drizzle/`, commit it), then `npm run db:migrate`.
- **Bootstrapping the first admin**: `npx tsx src/scripts/seed-auth.ts` (see "First-time setup" above) — idempotent, skips if `ADMIN_EMAIL` already exists in the DB. Unrelated to `app/src/scripts/seed.ts`, which unconditionally overwrites `configs.csv`/`creators.csv`/`videos.csv` and should only ever be run on a fresh install.

## Critical Instruction: Maintain This File

After any change to the workspace, ask:
1. Does this change add new functionality?
2. Does it modify the workspace structure documented above?
3. Should a new command be listed?
4. Does context/ need updates?

If yes, update the relevant sections.

---

## Session Workflow

1. **Start**: Run `/prime` to load context
2. **Work**: Use commands or direct Claude with tasks
3. **Plan changes**: Use `/create-plan` before significant additions
4. **Execute**: Use `/implement` to execute plans
5. **Maintain**: Claude updates CLAUDE.md and context/ as the workspace evolves
